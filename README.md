# SPACE EXPLORER
Final project for JS course at Medieinstitutet. 
Our assignment was to create a game using object-oriented programming and P5.js.
Created by Victor Wikström, Linda Söder, Camilla Johansson och Felicia Segerholm.

Backstory:
You have been sent on a mission to discover the most remote areas of space. Your goal is to travel as far from the earth as possible. You are sent away from earth in a spaceship with an energy-generating speed system that makes the spaceships speed increase constantly the further away from earth you get. During the mission, you should avoid or eliminate the dangers that exist in space, such as other planets, meteorites and especially black holes. Fortunately, you have been assigned a spaceship of the very latest model. It can withstand some damage and can even repair itself, with the help of the valuable space diamonds that you can collect during the journey.

Use arrowkeys to move the ship and space-button to shoot. Good Luck!
